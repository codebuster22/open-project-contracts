# NPA Registry and NPA Auction for banks

## Description
This project was undertaken for a research work. We were studying the impact of NPA and trying to find a solution for it.
We created smart contract where a NPA can be registered and can be used to prove ownership and details of the NPA. The same blockchain platform can be used to auction the NPA or bi-sell to other banks.
